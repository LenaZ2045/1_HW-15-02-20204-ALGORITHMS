ALGORITM FOR LINEAR APPROACH TO FIND SQUARE SUM OF ALL ELELMENTS IN THE ARRAY

1) REALIZE the solution of this algorithm
2) START writing the linear approach algorithm
3) READ the task
4) UNDERSTAND the task
5) TASK find the array sum adding each squared elements in the array
6) DEFINE the array
7) INPUT this array on board or paper
8) JAVA CODE calculate the sum of squeared elements in the array
9) CREATE Java class - " public class SumOfSquares {"
10) WRITE method to calculate this task(list #5) in the method of SumOfSquares class
11) JAVA CODE METHOD write next line - " public static int sumOfSquares (int [ ] arr) {" - open body
12) RELEASE logic of the sumOfSquares() method next line - " int sum = 0;"
13) START CYCLE in the method next line - " for (int num : arr) {" - open body
14) TYPE cycle body that calculates eacn element in the array into squares - " sum += num * num; }" - close cycle body
15) GIVE the result by writitng next line - " returm sum; }" - close the method body
16) WRITE Java code for running the Java code in the (main static class) over the next line - " public static void main(String[] args) {" - open main class body
17) WRITE Java code creating the array next line - " int[ ] array = {3, 6, 4, 7, 2, 1, 9};"
18) WRITE Java code launching the array over the method we created in SumOfSquares class next line - " int result = sumOfSquares(array);"
19) AS RESULT to see in the console write next line - " System.out.println("Sum of squares for elements in array = " + result); }" -close main body - " } " - close SumOfSquares class body
20) TEST by using calculator or paper and pen to square each element in the array entering - "3x3=9, 6x6=36, 4x4=16, 7x7=49, 2x2=4, 1x1=1, 9x9=81" - add up all answers from squared elements together - " 9+36+16+49+4+1+81=196"
21) COMPARE answers from the console in Java code with your calculations tha it is equal - " 196 Java console = 19 6My calculations" - equal
22) TASK is complete and resolved correctly
23) END
